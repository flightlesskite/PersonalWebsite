        <h3>Academics</h3>

        <p>I went to the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk">University of Strathclyde</a> for
            my UG degree in International Business + Marketing from 2013-2017.</p>
        <p>As part of my programme, I went on an exchange to
        <a href="https://telfer.uottawa.ca/en/">Telfer, School of Management</a>
            in Ottawa, Canada for half a year.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating, I started my Masters Degree in Software Development at the
        <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow </a> later that year.
        </p>

        <p>
        Modules I completed during my Software Development course were:
        <ul>
            <li>Programming (Java)</li>
            <li>Advanced Programming (Java)</li>
            <li>Database Theory and Application (SQL + Java)</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
            <li>Systems and Networks</li>
            <li>Software Engineering (UML + JUnit)</li>
            <li>Internet Technology (Python + Django)</li>
            <li>Software Project Management</li>

            <li>Enterprise Cyber Security</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        I would consider going for a PhD much later on in my life if presented with the opportunity.
            For now, I wish to pursue a career in Software Development & continue honing my technical skills.
